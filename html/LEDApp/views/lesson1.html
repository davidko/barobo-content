        <h2>What is an LED and how it works. RGB and color.</h2>
        <p>The letters LED stand for light emitting diode. The Linkbot has three, a red, a green and a blue.
            You can use these to create a variety of colors with the Linkbot. In this section you will learn
            to control the color the Linkbot displays. Use the skills you learned in art class to make colors
            other than the three built into the Linkbot.</p>
        <pre>
import barobo
import time
dongle = barobo.Dongle()
dongle.connect()
robot = dongle.getLinkbot('R2D2')

robot.setBuzzerFrequency(1046.5)
time.sleep(1.5)
robot.setBuzzerFrequency(0)
time.sleep(3)
robot.setLEDColor(255,0,0)

        <p>Change the color to green and then to blue by changing the position of the number 255.</p>
        <img src="img/led-colors.png" alt="RGB illumination" />
        <p>Create different shades of yellow, orange, and purple by making all three numbers values. Make all the numbers 255 to see what you get.  The maximum for each color is 255.</p>
