    <p>
      We mentioned at the beginning of last section that we were only
      going to show you some abbreviated pieces of code.
      If you 
      were curious, you may have expanded the code examples and looked
      at the whole unabridged Python code. What you saw was probably 
      something like this:
    </p>
    <pre class="programlisting"> 
#!/usr/bin/env python

# File: ch4simple.py
# A simple and complete Python program that moves the motors on a Linkbot

import barobo

dongle = barobo.Dongle()
dongle.connect()
linkbot = dongle.getLinkbot('ABCD')

# Move all joints by 90 degrees in the positive direction
linkbot.move(90, 90, 90)
 </pre>
    <p> 
      You may recognize the last line of that piece of code from 
      the previous chapter and the previous section. It
      is the piece of code that actually makes the robot move. 
      Lets take a closer look at this code, one line at a time.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first line
      looks like this:
      </p><pre class="programlisting"> #!/usr/bin/env python </pre><p>
      This line tells the computer that the program is a Python program.
      You should remember to put this line at the top of all of your 
      Python programs.  Many different languages have some sort
      of boilerplate code; some more complex than others. The next two lines
      look like this:
      </p><pre class="programlisting">
# File: ch4simple.py
# A simple and complete Python program that moves the motors on a Linkbot
      </pre><p>
      Note that these lines and the first line of code begin with the '#'
      character. In programmer-speak, this character is usually referred to
      as a "pound-sign" or a "hash" character. This character has
      special meaning in Python. It tells the Python interpreter to ignore
      anything else that comes after it in the line. This is known as a 
      <span class="emphasis"><em> comment </em></span>. Comments are text that are meant tell
      a human reader some information but are ignored by the computer as the
      computer executes the program.
    </p> <p>
      Next, we see
      </p><pre class="programlisting">
import barobo
      </pre><p>
      The <code class="code">import</code> command tells Python to import a package. Python packages are code
      libraries written by people to perform tasks that are not part of Python's
      default functionality. For instance, there are packages specifically
      designed to handle graphics, or play sounds, or perform highly complex
      number-crunching functions. Here, we import a package called "barobo",
      which is a package specially designed to manage and control Barobo robots,
      including the Linkbot.
    </p> <p>
      Once a package is imported, you can access its contents by specifying
      its name. For instance, consider the next line of code in the
      sample program:
      </p><pre class="programlisting">
dongle = barobo.Dongle()
      </pre><p>
      The code <code class="code">barobo.Dongle()</code> creates a Barobo Dongle object and
      stores it inside the variable <code class="code">dongle</code> using the assignment
      operator, "<code class="code">=</code>". This is a special type
      of complex variable that is neither a number nor a string. The dongle object
      has a list of its own functions that can be executed to perform tasks.
      For instance, the next line,
      </p><pre class="programlisting">
dongle.connect()
      </pre><p>
      connects to your Barobo Dongle. (If you do not have a Barobo Dongle attached to
      your computer when you execute this line, you might receive an error message)
    </p> <p>
      The next line,
      </p><pre class="programlisting">
linkbot = dongle.getLinkbot('ABCD')
      </pre><p>
      tells the dongle object to find a Linkbot with the serial ID "ABCD" and
      assign it to the variable "<code class="code">linkbot</code>".

    </p> <p>
      These three lines are required to to get control of a Linkbot with the
      serial ID "ABCD". Of course, if you decide to try and execute this code, 
      you will probably want to change "ABCD" to the serial ID of your own
      Linkbot.
