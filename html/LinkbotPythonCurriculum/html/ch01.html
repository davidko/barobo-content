    You may already have an idea of what a robot is from a variety of TV shows 
    and movies. They vary from tiny wheeled vehicles that beep and boop to
    humanoid intellegent translators such as C-3PO to gigantic transforming
    robots like Optimus Prime. To roboticists, the definition of a robot is any
    machine capable of performing a programmed task and interacting with
    its physical environment with motors, actuators, and sensors. You may
    be surprised to know that, by this definition, even your refrigerator 
    may be considered a robot! Many modern refrigerators are capable of 
    automatically making ice, maintaining a correct amount of ice in the
    freezer, and even dispensing the ice at the touch of a button. This
    machine is running a program, uses actuators to move the ice around,
    and has sensors such as buttons and temperature sensors.

    Indeed, robots and robotic systems have proliferated modern life, and
    as such, the study of robotics has become extremely important. In 
    addition to learning about robotics for the sake of robotics, certain
    robots are specifically designed to help teach programming, math, science, 
    physics, and even music! One such robot is the Linkbot modular robot.
    The Linkbot has been designed to be low-cost, fully-featured, tough, and
    easily programmable for day-to-day use by students and hobbyists of all 
    ages, and that is the robot that the following chapters will teach you
    how to use.

  <p>
    This curriculum is designed to bring someone with limited programming
    experience up to speed with programming a Linkbot using the Python
    programming language. Python is a free, fully featured, and easy 
    language to learn and use. It's unique design makes it popular among
    a large spectrum of programmers from absolute beginners to code 
    wizards. It is commonly used as both an introductory language at
    universities as well as an 
    all-purpose in-house language by many major software and technology companies.
