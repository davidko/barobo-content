        Once you have opened PyScripter, begin by creating a new program. You 
        can do this by clicking on the "New File" icon in the toolbar on
        the left hand side, or by clicking "File -&gt; New" in the menu.
      </p><p>
        Once you have opened a new file, try typing the following code
        into the window. Make sure you type the code in exactly as shown,
        including capitalization and punctuation.
        </p><div class="example"><a name="hello.py"></a><p class="title"><b>Example&nbsp;4.1.&nbsp;A simple Python program</b></p><div class="example-contents">
          <pre class="programlisting">
<span style="color: red">&lt;xi:include&gt;&lt;/xi:include&gt;</span>
          </pre>
        </div></div><p><br class="example-break">
        After you have typed it in, save it to a file called "hello.py". 
        Python programs typically use the suffix ".py".
      </p><p>
        </p><div class="figure"><a name="fig_ninja_hello"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure&nbsp;4.2.&nbsp; A Ninja-IDE Window after executing hello.py. </b></p><div class="figure-contents">
          
          <div class="mediaobject"><img src="images/fig_ninja_hello.png" alt="A Ninja-IDE Window after executing hello.py."></div>
        </div></div><p><br class="figure-break">
        Once you have saved your new program to a file, click on the "Run File"
        icon 
        <span class="guiicon">
          <span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="images/ninja_runfile.png"></span>
        </span>
        on the toolbar an the left-hand
        side to run your program. Ninja should pop up an output window pane
        with the results of your program, which should appear as shown in Figure
        <a class="xref" href="ch04s02s02.html#fig_ninja_hello" title="Figure&nbsp;4.2.&nbsp; A Ninja-IDE Window after executing hello.py.">Figure&nbsp;4.2, &#8220; A Ninja-IDE Window after executing hello.py. &#8221;</a>. As shown in the figure, the output of
        this program is
        <code class="computeroutput">Hello, world!</code>
        Congratulations! You have just written and executed your first Python program!
      </p> <p>
        Now, lets talk about the program you just wrote. The file, "hello.py",
        is called "Source Code". Source code for most major programming languages
        is in a format called "plain text", which is the same format in ".txt"
        files, which you may already be familiar with. This bare-bones format
        cannot support any word-processor features which you may be used to, such as
        different fonts, font sizes, embedded images, etc. 
      </p> <p>
        Python is capable of running program directly from source code using a 
        process called "interpretation". Some other languages like C, C++, and
        Java require the source code to be first "compiled" before it can be 
        executed. The process of compilation is basically when another program,
        called a "compiler", interprets human-readable source code into a
        machine-native program (ones and zeros). 
      </p> <p>
        Python programs contain multiple lines of code. Typically, when a computer
        executes code, it will start at the top of the file and execute statements,
        line by line, going down the file. As we write more complex programs, there
        are various ways for us to control how Python reads our program, but
        for simple programs like our <code class="filename">hello.py</code>, we can imagine
        Python starting at the top of our file and executing each line in order.
        Thus, multiple print statements in our program will print multiple
        lines of text onto our screen.

        <p>
          Lets take a closer look at your first Python program. The first line
          looks like this:
          </p><pre class="programlisting"> #!/usr/bin/env python </pre><p>
          This line tells the computer that the program is a Python program.
          You should remember to put this line at the top of all of your 
          Python programs. This type of code which goes into all of your programs
          is known as "Boilerplate" code. Many different languages have some sort
          of boilerplate code; some more complex than others. The next two lines
          look like this:
          </p><pre class="programlisting">
# File: hello.py
# Prints the text "Hello, world!" onto the screen
          </pre><p>
          Note that both this code and the first line of code begin with the '#'
          character. In programmer-speak, this character is usually referred to
          as the "pound" character or a "hash" character. This character has
          special meaning in Python. It tells the Python interpreter to ignore
          anything else that comes after it in the line. This is known as a 
          <span class="emphasis"><em> comment </em></span>. Comments are text that are meant tell
          a human reader some information but are ignored by the computer.
        </p> <p>
          Finally, the last line of code in the program is
          </p><pre class="programlisting">
print('Hello, world!')
          </pre><p>
          This is where the real stuff happens: printing text onto the screen.
          The word <code class="function">print</code> is a special command in python that is
          used to print text onto the screen. It is known as a <span class="emphasis"><em>function</em></span>. Python
          comes with hundreds of built-in functions you can use to do a variety
          of stuff. The simplest functions are fairly straight-forward to use:
          Type the name of the function, followed by an open-parentheses '(', 
          followed by any arguments the function needs or expects separated by commas, followed by a close
          paretheses ')'. In our case, the print function needs you to give it something
          to print. In our example, we gave it the string 'Hello, world!' to print.
          We will introduce more functions as you become familiar
          with the language.

        <p>
          Eventually, you will accidentally try to run Python programs
          with typos in them. This is totally normal and completely unavoidable.
          Unintentional errors in computer programs are called <span class="emphasis"><em>bugs
          </em></span>. The process of finding and fixing bugs is called
          <span class="emphasis"><em> debugging </em></span>.
          Depending on where you make your typos, you may damage your Python
          program enough such that Python can no longer properly run your program.
          This type of error is called a <span class="emphasis"><em>Syntax Error</em></span>. Common syntax errors are
          missing parentheses, missing quotation marks, and improperly indented
          code. When Python encounters
          a syntax error, it will give you an error message.
        </p> <p>
          Consider the following program:
          </p><div class="example"><a name="hello_bad.py"></a><p class="title"><b>Example&nbsp;4.2.&nbsp;A Python program with a syntax error.</b></p><div class="example-contents">
            
            <pre class="programlisting">
<span style="color: red">&lt;xi:include&gt;&lt;/xi:include&gt;</span>
            </pre>
          </div></div><p><br class="example-break">
          When we try to run the program, we get the following output:
          </p><pre class="screen">
            <span style="color: red">&lt;xi:include&gt;&lt;/xi:include&gt;</span>
          </pre><p>
          Errors like this may seem daunting at first. Sometimes, the error 
          messages can be cryptic. However, the first two lines indicate that
          the error is possibly at line 7, and even points to a possible location
          with a little tick mark. Can you spot the error there? Generally, syntax 
          errors are on the reported line or sometimes a few lines before.
