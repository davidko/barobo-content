  <p>
    Welcome to "Programming the Barobo Linkbot with Python". The goals of
    this book are to familiarize you with the Python programming language
    and essential concepts of programming robots. The book accomplishes 
    this in a "Robot-centric" manner: It teaches you how to do cool things
    with your Linkbot, and you learn computer science principles 
    along the way as a side effect of making the robot do cool things.
    This breaks the old paradigm of teaching programming, which typically
    focuses on one particular core concept, such as loops or functions,
    per chapter. At the same time, we make sure to include all of the
    important computer science concepts in this book, as well as 
    a good amount of real computer science jargon to prepare you for 
    real-world programming.
  </p> <p>
    The intended audience for this book are people with some computer
    experience and some basic math (Pre-Algebra) experience. The user
    should be familiar with the concept of files and folders, and
    opening and saving files, such as in Microsoft Word. 
    Familiarity with word processing concepts, such as copy/paste, will
    also be extremely useful when copying large parts of code from
    file to file.
    No prior 
    programming or robotics experience is required to follow this curriculum.
  </p> <p>
    Some additional software is required for you to follow along with the
    lessons in this book. The required software includes Python, several
    third-party Python packages including our own Linkbot Control package,
    and a good code editor. The easiest way to obtain, install, and setup
    all of the software is to download and install our all-in-one Python
    Curriculum bundle. The bundle includes:
    </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"> <p>Python and all required and suggested Python packages. </p></li><li class="listitem"> <p>PyScripter : A powerful and pretty looking code editor. </p></li><li class="listitem"> <p>Curriculum code example programs. </p></li><li class="listitem"> <p>Many other packages for numerical analysis, graphics, writing games, and much, much more. </p></li></ul></div><p>
    Some users may not want to install our bundle. These include Python
    gurus who already have a version of Python installed, and other advanced
    users. For everyone else, we highly recommend you use our bundled application.
